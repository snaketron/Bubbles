  In this tutorial we will use Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection 
  (UMAP) algorithm for dimension reduction of single cell expression data. We 
  will ask and answer the following questions: 
  i) why do people use UMAP?
  ii) does UMAP work as advertised for datasets with varying complexity
  iii) do we get similar UMAPs with different pre-processing steps (e.g. 
  data normalization)
  iv) do we need an alternative/enhancement of UMAP?

# About

In this tutorial we will use Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection 
(UMAP) algorithm for dimension reduction of single cell expression data. We 
will ask and answer the following questions: 
  
  1. why do people use UMAP?
  2. does UMAP work as advertised for datasets with varying complexity
  3. do we get similar UMAPs with different pre-processing steps (e.g. 
  data normalization)
  4. can we think of an alternative/enhancement of UMAP?

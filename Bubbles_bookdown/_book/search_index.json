We will ask and answer the following questions: why do people use UMAP? does UMAP work as advertised for datasets with varying complexity do we get similar UMAPs with different pre-processing steps (e.g.  data normalization) can we think of an alternative/enhancement of UMAP? "],["umap.html", "Chapter 2 UMAP 2.1 Data simulation 2.2 UMAP parameters", " Chapter 2 UMAP UMAP is an algorithm for non-linear dimension reduction. UMAP learns the manifold structure of the input data, and finds a low dimensional embedding that preserves the topological structure of that manifold. Here we will simulate data and generate 2D UMAP 2.1 Data simulation \\(N\\)=100 cells \\(F\\)=2 features (F1 and F2) Gene expression matrix \\(Y^{N \\times F}\\) \\(Y^{[1:50, F1]} \\sim N(0, 1)\\) \\(Y^{[51:100, F1]} \\sim N(5, 2)\\) \\(Y^{[1:100, F2]} \\sim N(0, 1)\\) 2.1.1 F1 and F2 distribution 2.2 UMAP parameters UMAP has a lot of parameters. See full list below. FALSE n_neighbors n_components metric FALSE &quot;15&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;euclidean&quot; FALSE n_epochs input init FALSE &quot;200&quot; &quot;data&quot; &quot;spectral&quot; FALSE min_dist set_op_mix_ratio local_connectivity FALSE &quot;0.1&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;1&quot; FALSE bandwidth alpha gamma FALSE &quot;1&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;1&quot; FALSE negative_sample_rate a b FALSE &quot;5&quot; NA NA FALSE spread random_state transform_state FALSE &quot;1&quot; NA NA FALSE knn knn_repeats verbose FALSE NA &quot;1&quot; &quot;FALSE&quot; FALSE umap_learn_args FALSE NA 2.2.1 n_neighbors (default n_neighbors: 15) n_neighbors controls the resolution at which UMAP learns the manifold structure of the data. If n_neighbors is set to a too low value, UMAP will zoom into local neighborhood when attempting to learn the manifold structure of the data. The opposite will happen if n_neighbors is set to a too high value. Lets set n_neighbors=3 and look at the resulting UMAP. As expected, we see that UMAP focuses on learning from local structure and misses the global structure. As a result we get stringy UMAP layout. The opposite should happen for e.g. n_neighbors=100, the overal (global) structure should be captured better but at the loss of some of the finer local structure compared to the initial example where we set n_neighbors=15. As there are only 100 cells in our data, n_neighbors=15 was already high enough and we do not see that much of difference in the newly built UMAP. 2.2.2 min_dist (default min_dist: 0.1) min_dist determines the compactness/clumpiness of the data points as it provides the minimum possible distance that may exist between any two points. Below two panels show UMAPs with min_dist=\\(10^{-5}\\) (left panel) and min_dist=0.99 (right panel) 2.2.3 n_components (default n_components: 2) As in other dimension reduction algorithms, UMAP can perform dimension reduction to a specific number of dimensions. This is regulated by the parameter n_components. 2.2.4 metric (default metric=‘Euclidean’) This parameters determines how distances are computed between the cells. Many different metrics are available "],["cross.html", "Chapter 3 Cross-references 3.1 Chapters and sub-chapters 3.2 Captioned figures and tables", " Chapter 3 Cross-references Cross-references make it easier for your readers to find and link to elements in your book. 3.1 Chapters and sub-chapters There are two steps to cross-reference any heading: Label the heading: # Hello world {#nice-label}. Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 3. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 3.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively.

If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 7.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.
